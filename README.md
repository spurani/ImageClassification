# ImageClassification
Solving image classification problems using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Python

Image Classigication (also called Image Recognition) is the process of labelling or categorising an image from a set of predefined target class. Traditionally, in machine learning, image classification solutions involved computing various types of features that were engineered for a particular problem domain. These features were then used as input to train a classifier, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) or multinomial Logistics Regression.

With the advent of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the process has shifted to a more end-to-end learning process (instead if learning only the classifier). In contrast to traditional machine learning techniques, the features are also learned during the training of the CNNs. Deep CNNs can learn to classify images into thousands of classes. These networks also form the basis for many advanced computer vision problems like Segmentation and Object Detection.
